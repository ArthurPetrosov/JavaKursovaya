### Report on the results of automation

All scenarios described in the plan have been automated
Basic Gradle reporting for generating information about tests in the work preparation process has been changed
to Allure reporting as more visual

Difficulties with data analysis from the database with the help of automation were avoided (as it was only affected
superficial information about adding data to the database)
Difficulties arose with testing the form itself - lack of experience (testing visibility / text
was not formed immediately, testing the database in the page object, did not immediately remember that the values were not
should be hard)

# Actual execution time (in hours):
- 1 hour project setup (according to the plan)
- 3 hours manual testing + reporting on the results of defects (according to the plan)
- 7 hours preparation for testing (+2 hours were required to generate non-rigid values for validation)
- 6 hours writing attestations (+ 2 hours needed to fix bugs)
- 1 hour reporting on the results of testing (less than indicated in the plan, but the result is not yet final)
- 1 hour reporting on the results of the project (less than indicated in the plan, but the result is not yet final)
