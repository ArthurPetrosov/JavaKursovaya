### Report on the results of automation

All scenarios described in the plan have been automated
Basic Gradle reporting for generating information about tests in the work preparation process has been changed
to Allure reporting as more visual

Difficulties with data analysis from the database with the help of automation were avoided (as it was only affected
superficial information about adding data to the database)
Difficulties arose with testing the form itself - lack of experience (testing visibility / text
was not formed immediately, testing the database in the page object, did not immediately remember that the values were not
should be hard)
